## Introduction

**GenAI** is a versatile command-line tool that streamlines **image generation**
and **webshop integration**. By leveraging **ChatGPT** (via Selenium
automation), it can programmatically create images, apply **background
removal**, perform **upscaling**, and finally **publish** these designs on
popular print-on-demand (POD) platforms such as **Spreadshirt** and
**Redbubble**.

**Key highlights** of GenAI include:

- **Direct ChatGPT Integration** Generate AI-driven designs or concept art using
  your **OpenAI** account via automated browser interactions.

- **One-Stop Workflow** Automatically remove backgrounds
  ([remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/)) and upscale images
  ([bigjpg.com](https://bigjpg.com/)) without leaving the command-line.

- **Seamless Uploads** Eliminate manual steps: GenAI can log you in, navigate to
  forms, fill out metadata (titles, tags, descriptions), and publish your new
  designs directly to your connected Spreadshirt/Redbubble storefronts.

- **Automated Account Verification** Manage user sessions and cookies to remain
  logged in across different services, reducing repetitive sign-ins.

- **Stable & Extensible** Built with maintainability in mind, the codebase
  follows robust design patterns that simplify adding new providers, image
  processing steps, or customization.

## Features

- **Background Removal** Automates background removal via Selenium on
  [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/).

- **Image Upscaling** Upscales images via Selenium on
  [bigjpg.com](https://bigjpg.com/).

- **Automatic Upload** Integrates with major POD sites:

  - [Spreadshirt](https://www.spreadshirt.de)
  - [Redbubble](https://www.redbubble.com)

- **AI Image Generation** Generates images using the **official ChatGPT**
  website in a browser automation workflow.

- **Account Verification** Streamlines verifying accounts and managing sessions
  so you can stay logged in for repeated tasks.

- **CLI-Centric** Provides a powerful command-line interface for both
  **experienced** and **casual** CLI users.

## Detailed Web Shop Usage Guide

### Spreadshirt Usage

1. **Verify Account**

Start by verifying your Spreadshirt account using the command:

```bash
genai verifysite Spreadshirt
```

This will open a Chrome window for you to log in. Once done, type `DONE` in the
console to save the session.

2. **Using Product Templates**

- Create a product template directly on Spreadshirt if needed. The tool will
  automatically use the most recently created template for uploads.
- The template **must contain** at least **50 products**

3. **Organizing Uploaded Files**

- Successfully uploaded designs are moved to the `used_spreadshirt` folder.
- Any designs with upload errors are moved to the `error_spreadshirt` folder for
  review.

### Redbubble Usage

1. **Verify Account**

- Start by verifying your Redbubble account with the following command:

```bash
genai verifysite Spreadshirt
```

- Alternatively, for first-time use, initiate the upload command, which will
  prompt for a login:

```bash
genai upload --upload-path "./images" redbubble
```

Once logged in, your session credentials are saved for future uploads.

2. **Redbubble Account Settings**

- Your Redbubble account must be set to `English` as the display language and
  use `$ United States Dollar (USD)` as the currency. These can be adjusted in
  your Redbubble account settings at the bottom of the webpage.

3. **Setting up the scaling settings**

- In the schling_adjustments.json the desired products can be switched on and
  off

4. **Organizing Uploaded Files**

- Successfully uploaded designs are moved to the `used_redbubble` folder.
- Any designs with upload errors are moved to the `error_redbubble` folder for
  review.

### ChatGPT Usage

1. **Verify Account**

- To use ChatGPT for generating images via web automation, first verify your
  account:

```bash
genai verifysite ChatGPT
```

- This will store your login session, enabling seamless automation with ChatGPT.

## Examples

![Explanation](assets/Explanation.png)

- **Generate images using GPT via web automation**:

  ```bash
  genai generate --output-directory ./images generategpt
  ```

- **Upload images from a directory to Spreadshirt**:

  ```bash
  genai upload --upload-path ./images spreadshirt
  ```

![genaiuploadspreadshirt](assets/upload.gif)

- **Verify OpenAI account in Chrome**:
  ```bash
  genai verifysites capsolver
  ```

## Performance

### Generate GPT Images

The `generategpt` command typically takes around 11 minutes to complete. This
duration includes the time required for AI-driven image creation, background
removal, and upscaling processes.

### Upload to Spreadshirt

Uploading images to Spreadshirt using the `upload spreadshirt` command generally
takes about 1 minute per batch of images. This includes logging in, navigating
to the upload form, filling out metadata, and publishing the designs.
